### Question1: Student Grades Processing

You need to write a Python program to process a student's grades. The program needs to perform the following functions:

Store information and notes for 10 students using a dictionary. Let each student have their name, surname and grades (Midterm, Final and Oral grades). For example:

1-Calculate each student's GPA and add it to the dictionary.

2-Find the student with the highest GPA and print it on the screen.

3- Separate each student's name from their surname and store them in a separate tuple and add them to a list.

4-Sort the names in alphabetical order and print the sorted list on the screen.

5-Keep students with a GPA below 70 in a cluster (set).

### Question 2: Film Library Management System Project

Project Description: This project aims to create an application that will help the user manage their movie collection. Users can add, edit, delete movies and view their collection.

Data Structures Used: Dictionaries (to store movies and related information), lists (to display movie collection)

Basic Functions:

1-Create a movie data by taking information such as movie name, director, release year and genre from the user and store it in a dictionary.

2-Give the user the option to edit or delete a movie. (For this, a suitable function must be written for whatever data they want to change about the movie.)

3-Allow the user to view their collection. List all movies or filter by criteria such as genre or year of release.

4-Save the movie data in a file and restore this data when you start the program.

### Question 3: Customer Management System
Project Description: This project involves you creating a customer management system that you can use to manage your customers and perform basic transactions. This system will have basic functions such as storing customer information, adding new customers, updating customer information, deleting customers and viewing the customer list. Here are the basic steps of the project:

1-Use a dictionary structure to store customer information. Assign a unique customer identification (ID) for each customer and associate customer information with this ID. You can use a dictionary containing information such as name, surname, e-mail, phone number for each customer.

2-Provide a menu where the user can choose the following actions:

* Add new customers
* Updating customer information
* Delete customer
* List all customers
* Check out

3-Perform the relevant action according to the user's choice. For example, when adding a new customer, get the required information from the user and add a new customer to the dictionary.

4-When updating customer information, view the current information using the customer ID and save the updated information.

5-In the customer deletion process, get the customer ID from the user and delete this customer from the dictionary.

6-In the process of listing all customers, view the list of existing customers.

7-Repeat the process until the user logs out.
