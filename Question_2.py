""" Question 2: Film Library Management System Project

Project Description: This project aims to create an application that will help the user manage their movie collection. Users can add, edit, delete movies and view their collection.

Data Structures Used: Dictionaries (to store movies and related information), lists (to display movie collection)

Basic Functions:

1-Create a movie data by taking information such as movie name, director, release year and genre from the user and store it in a dictionary.

2-Give the user the option to edit or delete a movie. (For this, a suitable function must be written for whatever data they want to change about the movie.)

3-Allow the user to view their collection. List all movies or filter by criteria such as genre or year of release.

4-Save the movie data in a file and restore this data when you start the program.
