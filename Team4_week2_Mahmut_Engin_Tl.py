"""Question1: Student Grades Processing
You need to write a Python program to process a student's grades. The program needs to perform the following functions:

Store information and notes for 10 students using a dictionary. Let each student have their name, surname and grades (Midterm, Final and Oral grades). For example:
students = {
    'Ahmet Yılmaz': [85, 90, 78],  # Midterm: 85, Final: 90, Oral: 78
    'Mehmet Demir': [82, 86, 76],  # Midterm: 82, Final: 86, Oral: 76
    'Ayşe Kaya': [78, 89, 95],     # Midterm: 78, Final: 89, Oral: 95
    'Zeynep Çelik': [65, 70, 80],  # Midterm: 65, Final: 70, Oral: 80
    'Ali Kara': [50, 60, 75],      # Midterm: 50, Final: 60, Oral: 75
    'Fatma Yıldız': [88, 95, 80],  # Midterm: 88, Final: 95, Oral: 80
    'Murat Aydın': [67, 68, 74],   # Midterm: 67, Final: 68, Oral: 74
    'Elif Aksoy': [95, 90, 85],     # Midterm: 95, Final: 90, Oral: 85
    'Hakan Öztürk': [45, 70, 54],   # Midterm: 45, Final: 70, Oral: 54
    'Canan Taş': [80, 75, 82]      # Midterm: 80, Final: 75, Oral: 82
}


1-Calculate each student's GPA and add it to the dictionary.

2-Find the student with the highest GPA and print it on the screen.

3- Separate each student's name from their surname and store them in a separate tuple and add them to a list.

4-Sort the names in alphabetical order and print the sorted list on the screen.

5-Keep students with a GPA below 70 in a cluster (set)."""







# Question 2: Film Library Management System Project
# Project Description: This project aims to create an application that will help the user manage their movie collection. Users can add, edit, delete movies and view their collection.

# Data Structures Used: Dictionaries (to store movies and related information), lists (to display movie collection)

# Basic Functions:

# 1-Create a movie data by taking information such as movie name, director, release year and genre from the user and store it in a dictionary.

# 2-Give the user the option to edit or delete a movie. (For this, a suitable function must be written for whatever data they want to change about the movie.)

# 3-Allow the user to view their collection. List all movies or filter by criteria such as genre or year of release.

# 4-Save the movie data in a file and restore this data when you start the program.
